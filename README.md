# Synopsis  
  
The Win32 App Migration Tool is designed to inventory ConfigMgr Applications and Deployment Types, build .intunewin files and create Win3Apps in The MEM Admin Center.  
  
Instead of manually checking Application and Deployment Type information and gathering content to build Win32apps, the Win32APp Migration Tool is designed to do that for you. To date, the Application and Deployment Type information is gathered and a .Intunewin file is created. We are also collecting the logo for the application.  
  
The Win32App Migration Tool is still in BETA so I would welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Reach out on Twitter to DM @byteben (DM's are open)
